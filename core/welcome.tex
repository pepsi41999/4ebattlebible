\section*{Objective}

The following book is a Standard Reference Document sourced from the
Warhammer 40,000 4th Edition Core Rule book.

This document paraphrases the essential text of its source while removing all
superfluous commentary in order to be a more useful tool for those needing a
rules reference.

Where deemed necessary the phrasing has been modified for clarity, though the
editors erred on the side of caution and strove to make no changes to the
function of the rules, nor neglect any edge cases where possible.

Please bear in mind this is still a draft version, therefor you might find technical
or grammatical errors. If you'd like to help please contact the original editor at
nusrdanon.tg@gmail.com or post directly on the dedicated 40k 4th Edition
Battle Bible thread on /tg/.
